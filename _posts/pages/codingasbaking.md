I started baking in 2018, after I binged watched Great British Bakeoff on Netflix. I have always wanted to bake. When I was still living in the Philippines as a child, I would salivate on the images of baked goods in American cookbooks. Ovens were a rarity (if non-existent) in households there, but here in America there's an oven in every house, so I was empowered in experimenting different bakes. 

And of course, I started with croissants. 

My husband thought I was crazy. Croissants are infamously very hard - but I was adamant. Failure is of course an option - and failure is what happened. My first bake was ugly, raw, and bad! 

I really wanted to make croissants so after that first attempt, I started baking basic bread: flour, water, salt, yeast. Knead, rest, bake. Pretty standard. But after six months of practicing up, I was finally able to create my first decent and very butter croissants.

I was so joyful in baking, I started organizing bakeoffs with family, friends, and people I work with. I wanted to share how fun and rewarding it was to create something out of nothing, give joy to people, and build relationship.

This is how I see coding is. Tech work should always be a means to create something out of nothing, give joy to people, and build relationships. This, I think, should be the center of any industry that creates things. It's a practice I have been doing for a long time now, and is at the center of everything I build, plan, and organize, may it be a community of tech workers, a bakeoff, or a tech project.
